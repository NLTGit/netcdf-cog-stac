This notebook demonstrates how to create Earth Engine assets backed by COGs.  An advantage of COG-backed assets is that the spatial and metadata fields of the image will be indexed at asset creation time, making the image more performant in collections.  (In contrast, an image created through `ee.Image.loadGeoTIFF` and put into a collection will require a read of the GeoTiff for filtering operations on the collection.)  A disadvantage of COG-backed assets is that they may be several times slower than standard assets when used in computations.\n",

If a COG-backed asset is shared in Earth Engine, it is the owner's responsibility to ensure that the data in GCS is shared with the same parties. If the data is not visible, Earth Engine will return an error of the form \"Failed to load the GeoTIFF at `gs://my-bucket/my-object#123456`\" (123456 is the generation of the object).\n",

See the [object versioning docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning) for details on generations. If a generation is specified (e.g., `gs://foo/bar#123`), Earth Engine will use it. If a generation is not specified, Earth Engine will use the latest generation of the object. \n",
